## Jonny D White

### About me

Im Jonny, someone with a passion for data analysis.  I also like a good bit of data visualisation.  


### Why Git Hub

Quite simply, i have always wanted to set up my own website, to talk about myself a bit more.  Who doesnt like talking about themselves hey? Not really.  This is a test website to explore how to use GitHub to produce a webpage.  I might carry on using it, i might not.  Who knows?

As i learn more, i might add to this.  Lets face it, with this lock down, i suddenly have a lot of time at home to focus on learning new things!

For now, bye.
